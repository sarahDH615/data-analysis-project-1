# Look at the “final” folder to see our exemplary code. 

### In the final folder you will find the following:
* notebooks folder: 
    - Our code used to gather search data from the Google API.
    - The code used to integrate the Covid, Stay At Home Orders, and API results. 
    - The code to generate bar, line, and mean comparison graphs.
 
* input_data folder:
    - A folder of CSVs with Covid, Stay At Home, and Google data for each state. These were later used to generate the graphs.

* output_graphs folder:
    - Pie Chart comparing 2019 and 2020 searches.
    - Various folders with graphs displaying the popularity of a given category throughout the year laid over a bar graph displaying the rise of Covid cases in a given state.
    - This also includes a folder with standard deviation line graphs to compare sub-categories.
