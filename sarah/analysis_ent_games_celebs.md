## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

**Other Entertainment (games and celebrities) overall:**
Differences in means differences for games/consoles/systems are significant save in South Dakota, where the late December 2019 spike overpowers the 2020 pattern found in South Dakota along with all the other states: spike in mid March - mid April, and dips in October, November, and early December. The means difference being significant means that generally, interest in video games rose in 2020 (save in SD). The spikes coincide with the start of cases appearing, and for most states, the start of lockdown. Since Wyoming follows this pattern, it should probably be assumed that if it is linked to coronavirus events, it is the start of the rise of cases that is correlating with the rise in interest in video games. 

All of the lottery/sweepstakes data have significant means differences between 2019 and 2020, with 2020 means being lower than 2019: general interest in lotteries fell during 2020. Except for Wyoming, which has some moderate peaks, all the states stay below the 2019 mean in 2020 for the most part, with popularity numbers increasing towards the end of December, though sometimes still not breaking the 2019 mean. All states except for South Carolina and Wisconsin had at least one dip below -1SD in the period between late March - mid April (SC and WI had dips there too, but they did not fall below -1SD of the 2020 data). Given that this pattern holds for WY (which didn't have a lockdown), it could correspond to the start of the rise of cases, where people were consumed with the start of the pandemic, so they had less time to spend on looking at the lottery (and perhaps were less interested because they felt they had to save money, and thus didn't enter lotteries). All states save South Dakota also had at least one dip below -1SD between late September and November. The late December increase in all states could be a sign that people are hopeful that things could be better in the new year. 

Means differences for states in the celebrity news category were signifcant for all states: generally, interest in celebrities rose during 2020. But these are due to high spikes in the first week of November. This doesn't necessarily appear tied to the pandemic, but perhaps instead the election. Depending on whether the candidates were considered 'celebrities', it could signify political interest, or it could be a sign of people trying to get away from election news by looking at celebrity news. There was also a fairly large jump in interest in late September. In fact, in Vermont, the late September spike was larger than the November one. As usual, Wyoming remained a state with many spikes in data, so whilst there was high interest in early November and late September, it was not as fair away from the 2020 mean as in other states (though still significant).
