## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

**Law Enf/Discrim overall:**
Both categories in this group have similar general patterns: pretty unvarying through both years, except for large rises in interest over the summer 2020, usually mid May - mid June. However, all the means differences for the discrimination category are significant, and none of the means differences are significant for the law enforcement category. This is where the means test is somewhat unhelpful - there are clear peaks even in the law enforcement data, but the general interest in law enforcement is higher generally (~40-60%) than in discrimination (~15-40%), so it obscures the rise within those summer months in 2020.
The pattern of rise through those summer months happens irrespective of lockdowns being in effect, or even happening within the state at all (see Wyoming), so those spikes in interest in both categories are most likely due to forces unrelated to coronavirus lockdowns.
