## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

**Health (Infectious Diseases, Health News) overall:**
Infectious disease interest generally rose for all states (means differences significance for all). The baseline interest in 2020 was a bit higher than 2019, but had a massive peak in the late March-mid April period, probably due to cases starting to rise. There were small bumps, usually not breaking the 2020 mean, in late January (as the coronavirus started getting reported), early July, and mid Novemeber and mid December. People generally were more interested in infectious diseases, but only massively cared when coronavirus first started rising in cases. 

Interest in health news rose for 6/11 of the states. All the states had a pattern of spikes of interest around April, and all save Wyoming had a spike in late March; these spikes correspond to the start of rise of cases. The states that did not show a significant change in means either had narrow spikes of interest in the late March/April period (like South Dakota), showed a falloff of interest in the second half of the year balancing the spikes in March/April (like Washington), or had 2019 data with more peaks and troughs, leading to a higher 2019 mean (like Vermont and Wyoming).
