## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

Generally interest in action-adventure films fluctuated through 2020. Most (9/11) of the states had a medium-to-large peak in interest in late October, but smaller drops in interest, usually starting in March, and continuing through the rest of the year, caused the 2020 means to remain roughly the same as 2019's. Only three states had significant means changes in interest in action-adventure films in 2020 compared to 2019: South Carolina's mean interest in action-adventure films increased, while South Dakota's and Texas' decreased. South Carolina had no major dips in film interest to counteract its spike in interest in late October. Meanwhile South Dakota was one of the states that had no peak in late October, and Texas' peak was only moderately sized, so both states' dips through the year caused their 2020 means to decrease. 

All states except Wyoming (which varied throughout the year but still had a higher 2020 mean than 2019) followed roughly the same pattern of fairly static interest in scifi/fantasy content, with moderate to high peaks in late October, November and December, and no strong dips in interest. The late autumn/early winter peaks were consistent with 2019 patterns - in fact, spikes in 2019 in those states were often higher than in 2020; the lack of dips in interest is what changed in 2020. In 5/11 states, while the peaks were at least above +1SD of 2019, they were still not high enough to largely change the 2020 mean of those states. In the other 6 states, the more consistent interest in scifi/fantasy raised the means in 2020. The interest does not seem linked to lockdowns. 

In the category tv shows, there was a lot of variability across 2019 and 2020 for the states. All of the states had several dips in interest in 2020, mostly in October and November, with 10/11 (Wyoming having a slight dip for this week) having a deep dip the first week of November, which coincides with the presidential election - perhaps that was where people's focus was instead of on tv shows. However, 5/11 states (UT, VT, WA, WV, WI) had non-significant means differences, due to having peaks in interest - the majority of those states (all save VT) had a moderate-to-high peak of interest in tv shows the second week of November; the majority of those states (all save UT this time) also had a peak in mid to late April, which would be towards the end of the lockdown for most of the states in general. However, since several other states also have lockdowns ending around this period without those spikes in interest, it is unknown why the four states have spikes at that point. It could simply be the way that those four states responded to the pandemic lockdown ending. 

For the category online video, most (8/11 - the exceptions are TN, TX, VA, which have increases beyond +1SD of the 2020 mean, but not as far up as +1SD of the 2019 mean) of the states followed the pattern of an increase (beyond +1SD of the 2019 mean) in interest around late March - early April. This increase, around the start of the rise in cases, could be due to starting to want to have more entertainment around a time where they might have been kept home. However, all states' early 2020 interest in online video fell sharply in the summer, usually around late June - July, perhaps as people started to want other things to do besides watch videos. Additionally, several states (SC, TN, UT, VT, WI, WY - the other states all had decreases, but less dramatic, and perhaps not significant - TX, SD and WV had values between +1SD of the 2020 mean and +1SD of the 2019 mean) had a sharp decrease in interest in online video the first week of November, which could also be due to a turn of attention towards the election. With these two decreases, all states except Texas and Washington, which did not have as dramatic decreases later in the year, showed significant decreased mean interest in online video.
