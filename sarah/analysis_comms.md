## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

### Communications
General in each year: around Dec for both (SC, SD, TN, only for 2019, WI) - Xmas spike? (not for TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WY)
staying generally btwn +/-1SD: SC, TX, VT, VA, WA
pretty spiky: SD, ~TN, ~UT, WY

#### South Carolina 
lockdown Apr onwards
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
spike (above +1SD for both 2019+2020) in late March, and in early/mid April 2020, unmatched in 2019 -- coincides with just before the start of lockdown (beginning of April) and the first few weeks of lockdown
#### Mobiles (means not stats signif)
_spike (slightly above 2020 mean) in mid Apr 2020 unmatched in 2019 (at that point in 2019, the popularity hovers between -1SD and below the means - ie pretty low) -- coincides with first few weeks of lockdown_
another spike (above +1SD of both years) in mid Oct 2020 - there are 2019 high spikes early Sep, late Sep, late Dec - could be when new mobiles came out - the mid Oct 2020 could be the muted and delayed version of the 2019 ones


#### South Dakota 
lockdown just Apr 
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
lots of variation in both years - spikes in similar place, but different heights - _peak in late Mar both year (slightly above 2019 mean in 2019, but a good bit above +1SD for 2020) - a few weeks before the start of lockdown._ There are peaks in mid March, early Aug, late Dec with both years above the +1SD lines, but all are a bit more muted in 2020 (only the Dec 2020 one is a good bit higher than the +1SD line). 
#### Mobiles (means not stats signif)
less variation in 2020 than 2019 - stays within +/-1SD for nearly all the year, while in 2019, there are early, late Sep, mid Nov spikes


#### Tennessee 
lockdown just Apr 
##### Voice/Video Chat (means **are** stats-signif)
_spike a bit above +1SD lines in mid Mar (a couple weeks before lockdown), and a bit smaller one (just above higher +1SD line) in early Apr (first week of lockdown)_
lower Xmas bump in 2020
#### Mobiles (means **are** stats signif)
big spike in 2019 early-mid Sep, but no such peak in 2020 - stays mostly btwn +/-1SD, no aboves, only dips - if anything, only lower than 2019

#### Texas 
lockdown just Apr 
##### Voice/Video Chat (means **are** stats-signif)
Very high 2020 spike mid-Mar - couple weeks before lockdown
not very high Xmas spike
#### Mobiles (means **are** stats signif)
Like Tenn, big spike 2019 in early-mid Sep, but not in 2020
small spike mid Oct 2020 (a bit above +1SD)

#### Utah 
lockdown just Apr 
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
high spikes in late Mar, early April 2020 (couple weeks before lockdown, couple weeks into it) - both years have insignif Xmas numbers
#### Mobiles (means **are** stats signif)
Like TX, TN, big spike 2019, early-mid Sep; like TX, 2020 has a small/medium spike mid Oct

#### Vermont 
lockdown late Mar-mid May 
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
spike mid Mar (couple weeks bfr lockdown), a couple smaller spikes lat Mar, mid Apr (a little above +1SD) (during lockdown) - has a late May spike to match the 2019 one
low Xmas nums for both years
#### Mobiles (means not stats signif)
spiky data
early Apr spike (3 weeks into lockdown), but it isn't a very high one, only a bit above +1SD
only Xmas spike in 2019

#### Virgina 
lockdown Apr - early June
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
early Mar high peak 2020 (couple weeks bfr lockdown)
2ndary peak mid May - middle of lockdown (not much of a May peak in 2019)
pretty low for rest of 2020 - a little more so than 2019
#### Mobiles (means **are** stats signif)
like TN, TX, UT, spike early-mid Sep 2019; spike mid Oct 2020

#### Washington 
lockdown Apr - early May
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
late Mar (couple weeks bfr lockdown) peak, 2ndary one early Apr (first week of lockdown)
not much of a Xmas peak
#### Mobiles (means **are** stats signif)
like TN, TX, UT, VA, spike early-mid Sep 2019; spike mid Oct 2020

#### West Virginia 
lockdown Apr onwards
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
2ndary peaks late Feb, mid Mar, mid Apr (a couple weeks into lockdown) -- 1st two don't seem linked to lockdowns or c19 (maybe the 2nd one is in prep for lockdown also?)
high peaks late Mar (couple weeks before lockdown), late Nov (Thanksgiving?)
#### Mobiles (means not stats signif)
looks similar to the TN, TX, UT, VA, WA spike early-mid Sep 2019; spike mid Oct 2020 pattern, but also a 2019 spike in early Dec, and a small 2020 spike in Feb - the means are not signif diff like in those states


#### Wisconsin 
lockdown Apr - late May
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
high peak mid Mar (three weeks before lockdown?), interest remaining relatively high through mid Apr
not so much a Xmas peak in 2020
#### Mobiles (means **are** stats signif)
part of the TN, TX, UT, VA, WA spike early-mid Sep 2019; spike mid Oct 2020 pattern, but like WV, has a (2ndary here) spike in early Dec 2019 too

#### Wyoming 
no lockdown
##### Voice/Video Chat (means not stats-signif)
pretty spiky
double peak mid Mar, early Apr
2ndry ones mid Feb, early May, late Sep (latter 2 barely above +1SD)
not much Xmas peak
#### Mobiles (means not stats signif)
Is like WV in that it looks like the TN, TX, UT, VA spike early-mid Sep 2019; spike mid Oct 2020 pattern, but isn't mean signif - there is more variation through both years (though few breaches of the +/-1SD) so that could be muddying things


**Comms overall:**
Most states had peaks the couple weeks before lockdown for VVC - but only two states (TN, TX) had signif means diffs for that cat, so the pattern could be random variation. This especially could be true, since WY had spikes around those times (mid Mar, early Apr) but had no lockdown.
Around half of the states (TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WI) had significant means differences for mobiles: those states conformed to a pattern of a spike in early-mid Sep 2019, and a mid Oct 2020 spike. A couple additional states also had that pattern (WV, WY), but their means differences were not significant. This pattern does not seem tied to lockdowns, as these spikes are in autumn, when none of those states were in lockdown. The other states had pretty unvaried mobile interest during 2020, but not significant means differences.
