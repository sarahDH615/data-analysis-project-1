## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

**Other Entertainment (general, arts/ent, media) overall:**
Arts/Entertainment was significant for all states but Vermont. Generally, in 2020, there was a lowering of interest in arts/entertainment from October into November, often with a dip in the summer earlier on in the year, with a little rise of interest in late December. Several states (SC, SD, UT, VT, WA, WV, WI) have small peaks during early - mid April, which is the start to middle of lockdown for those states. However, WY also has a little peak then, and WY had no lockdown, which suggests that the peak might not be due to lockdown. Meanwhile, the lowering of interest towards the end of the year does not appear to have any connection to lockdowns. Perhaps it is due to people being busy and stressed over the later pandemic months, causing them to have less time to look into arts/entertainment. Vermont, the only state not to have a significant means difference for this category, followed a similar pattern of a small peak over the lockdown time period, and a falloff of interest towards the end of the year. The difference is that the falloff did not occur over such a long period of time, and thus lowered the 2020 mean less.

Books and Literature was similar to Arts/Entertainment in 2020 having mid summer and autumn into winter dips in interest. The main difference between 2020 and 2019 for these categories, however, is the lack of peaks in early months of the year, which counterbalanced the dips in summer and autumn/winter in 2019. These also don't seem tied to lockdowns, and could just be '2020 fatigue' as well. 

Entertainment media had significant means differences in only two states. This seems to hide that most states had a spike in mid March to mid April, which is balanced in the means by autumn dips in interest. The two states that had significant means differences either had a wider or taller peak that still came through despite the end of year dip. These mid March and April peaks seem to line up pretty well with the start of lockdowns for most states, but Wyoming again still has this trend without the lockdown. Perhaps this common pattern instead marks people's interest in these categories due to rises in cases (and therefore thinking about trying to stay home, even if an official order wasn't put in place). The late year dips don't seem to be tied to any specific coronavirus event.
