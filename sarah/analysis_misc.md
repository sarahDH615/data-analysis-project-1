## Graphs Comparisons

Means comparisons: the means being different mean that one year, the category was more/less popular than the other - but that does not mean that the distribution throughout the year is the same - spikes in different places could still mean that covid is affecting the popularity of searches

**Miscellaneous (Weather, Autos, Beauty/Fitness, Sport News) overall:**
Weather only had significant means change in 4 states: South Dakota, Utah, Wisconson, and Wyoming. Those are all northern states with presumably harsher weather extremes. For 2019, all states had peaks in the winter/autumn months (January, February, October, November, December), and sometimes a small rise in the mid summer (July). In 2020, all four of those states lacked summer and end of the year peaks, perhaps suggesting less of an interest in weather since the emphasis in 2020 was staying home. But South Dakota and Wisconsin also lacked peaks in interest in January 2020. The weather potentially could have been milder in January 2020 in those states, leading to less interest, or there could be something else occurring that led to lack of weather interest then. 

A decrease in interest in automobiles was only significant in five states (TN, TX, VA, WA, WI). All states (whether with means significant difference or not) had a fall in interest in automobiles early-late March, coinciding with the start of rise in cases. But aside from the five states, there was a fair pickup in interest in vehicles in the summer months to match, albeit in a more muted way, the 2019 interests. In those five states, if there was a peak in interest in those months, it did not exceed +1SD of the 2020 data. Those five states do not have similar lockdowns as opposed to the others, or dististive 2019 levels of interest, nor are they in one single region, so it is unsure what makes their loss of interest in automobiles was caused by. Wyoming is an extreme case of being fairly unchanged in interest in automobiles 2019 and 2020, where the 2020 figures pretty closely match the 2019 ones (besides a short dip in mid March)

All states had a drop in interest in beauty/fitness in the first week of November - potentially people were so focused on the election, they stopped looking at beauty/fitness? Several states (TN, TX, UT, WA, WV) also had a drop in interest mid-late March (when cases started to rise). All these states save West Virginia were the only states with a significant drop in their mean for 2020 due to these dips. West Virginia had highly variable data, and had several other rises and falls through 2020. Both Tennessee and Texas followed this same significant drop pattern for both automobiles and beauty/fitness but the other states in those two categories do not match up. All states had a peak early to mid May, where most, but not all states were coming out of lockdown. It is therefore probably not related strictly with the end of lockdown, but rather with the pandemic carrying on, and people attempting to improve their appearance after the several weeks of lockdown. 

General interest in sport news decreased for all states. All states had a mid year dip in interest, starting in March through June or July, lowering their means. Most states' interest remained fairly low for the majority of the year, but a few states had some small peaks: South Dakota had a peak in mid April, and Vermont had one in mid August. Searches for sport news was probably lower because many sports competitions were cancelled through 2020 because of the rise in cases, so people learned this and stopped searches for news on sports.
